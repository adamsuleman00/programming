# Debugging
Debugging is the process of identifying and removing any bugs or any issues affecting the performance within an application, in order for it to work as intended. If these issues have not been solved, then the software may run slowly or crash. In order to prevent issues from occurring, a debugger will run and analyse the code to see if there are any bugs or issues, which will then display where the bugs are in the code if there are any. This method is mostly used within testing phases of software development.
## Debugging Facilities
### Breakpoints
Breakpoints allow the code to have markers that can be placed on specific lines of code which is pointed out during execution of the source code. This allows for programmers to examine current version of the program to ensure that it is working as intended. It is important to prevent these issues from happening again, as the application might contain incorrect values, which may result in the outcome of errors and further problems.
### Output Console
The output console allows the developer to view a real-time log and list bugs or problems the IDE detects when running the application code. This tool is used to output certain information into a console. The console reports any errors detected while the application is being run, otherwise everything should work as intended. 
### Variable changing
Variable changing is used to change variables in the code during runtime. This is possible by using breakpoints so that the code will end in certain parts. The system will then change the variables, which will then test the different outcomes. This can be useful for developers, as they can locate the values that cause errors in the program, so that it forces the code to not accept them. 
### Call stack viewing
Call stack viewing is used to view what functions or procedure calls are declared at certain points in the program. This tool shows the order in which methods and functions are getting called. This tool can be useful for a developer to examine and understand the execution flow of an application.
