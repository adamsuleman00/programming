# programming-paradigms

## Introduction
This report will compare the three specific programming paradigms, which are procedural, object oriented, and event driven.  
The term programming paradigm is the way of thinking about and approaching problems. There can be more than one type programming paradigms. Hereâ€™s a list of the most common ones:

## Procederal Programming
Procedural programming is concerned with defining a linear procedure or sequence of programming statements. Examples of procedural languages are COBOL, BASIC and C. These languages structured in step by step, according to the particular programmer at least, be followed to solve a specific problem. A key feature of the paradigm is the partitioning of functionality into small discrete re-usable modules called procedures that contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. A procedural code example is executed from a single point of control or entry point which calls out into declared procedures, which in turn may call other procedures. 

## Object Oriented Programming
Object oriented programming is a programming language that features concepts, such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphic. Examples of popular object oriented programming languages, such as Java, C++, and C# that can be used to follow this paradigm. Data as well as operations are encapsulated as objects. Objects interact by the means of message passing, by calling methods on other entities. 

## Event Driven Programming
Event driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program  depends on the events, such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs or messages from programs. Event driven programming is manily used in graphical user interfaces (such as Javascript web applications) that focuses certain actions in response to user input.
