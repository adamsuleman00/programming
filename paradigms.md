## Introduction
This report will compare the three specific programming paradigms, which are procedural, object oriented, and event driven.  
The term programming paradigm is the way of thinking about and approaching problems. There can be more than one type programming paradigms. Hereâ€™s a list of the most common ones:

## Procederal Programming
Procedural programming is concerned with defining a linear procedure or sequence of programming statements. A key feature of the paradigm is the partitioning of functionality into small discrete re-usable modules called procedures (subroutines or functions) that act like small programs themselves with their own scope, inputs and outputs. A procedural code example is executed from a single point of control or entry point which calls out into declared procedures, which in turn may call other procedures. 

## Object Oriented Programming
Object oriented programming is a programming language that features concepts, such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphic. Examples of popular object oriented programming languages such as Java, C++, and C# that can be used to follow this paradigm. Data as well as operations are encapsulated as objects. Objects interact by the means of message passing, by calling methods on other entitites. 
Objects can extend other objects, inheriting some or all of the attributes and behaviours from the parent providing specific modular reuse. Objects can be treated as a parent type (an object in its inheritance tree) allowing the use or application of the objects in the program without the caller knowing the specifics of the behaviour or data inside the object. This general property is called polymorphism, which exploits the encapsulation of attributes and behaviour within objects and their capability of being treated (viewed or interacted with) as a parent type.
## Event Driven Programming
Event driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program  depends on the events, such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs or messages from programs. Event driven programming is manily used in graphical user interfaces (such as Javascript web applications) that focuses certain actions in response to user input.
