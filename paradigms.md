# programming-paradigms

## Introduction
This report will compare the three specific programming paradigms, which are procedural, object oriented, and event driven.  
The term programming paradigm is the way of thinking about and approaching problems. There can be more than one type programming paradigms. Hereâ€™s a list of the most common ones:

## Procederal Programming
Procedural programming is a paradigm in which code is structured into linear sequence of programming staemenets, called Procedures (also known as subroutines). Examples of popular procedural languages used are COBOL, BASIC and C. These languages are structured in step by step, according to the particular software developer at least, be followed to solve a specific problem. A key feature of the paradigm is the codebase partitioned into re-usable blocks of code, which can be used in the project. This is useful as it helps to reduce repitition and improve the developers abilty to finish their tasks effectively. Procedures can use input (such as arguments and parammeters) and gives an output as a result.

## Object Oriented Programming
Object oriented programming (OOP) is focused on hierarchy of classes and defined object. Examples of popular object oriented programming languages, such as Java, C++, and C# that can be used to follow this paradigm. Classes and objects are encapsulated and the code is split into reusable subsystems. 

## Event Driven Programming
Event driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program  depends on the events, such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs or messages from programs. Event driven programming is manily used in graphical user interfaces (such as Javascript web applications) that focuses certain actions in response to user input. This paradigm is often used for interactive applications such as video games.

## Relationships
Procedural programming defines the program in a series of steps which is executed in direct order. This programming style is structured, thus has to be created in a specific order. In addition, in Event-driven programming is created by writing event handling procedures. However, they are similar as the code in the event listeners is procedural as they contain functions calls, which must run in the order the instructions, are written in.
Object-orientated programming implementation of the code is different to procedural and event-driven as it does not use inputs or follow code in a logical order. Object-orientated programming runs on classes and objects, which are different compared to other paradigms. A class act as a blueprint while Object is paired together with data and actions.
