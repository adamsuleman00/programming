# programming-paradigms

## Introduction
This report will compare the three specific programming paradigms, which are procedural, object oriented, and event driven.  
The term programming paradigm is the way of thinking about and approaching problems. There can be more than one type programming paradigms. Hereâ€™s a list of the most common ones:

## Procederal Programming
Procedural programming is a paradigm in which code is structured into linear sequence of programming staemenets, called Procedures (also known as subroutines). Examples of popular procedural languages used are COBOL, BASIC and C. These languages are structured in step by step, according to the particular software developer at least, be followed to solve a specific problem. A key feature of the paradigm is the codebase partitioned into re-usable blocks of code, which can be used in the project. This is useful as it helps to reduce repitition and improve the developers abilty to finish their tasks effectively. Procedures can use input (such as arguments and parammeters) and gives an output as a result.


## Object Oriented Programming
Object oriented programming is a programming language that features concepts, such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphic. Examples of popular object oriented programming languages, such as Java, C++, and C# that can be used to follow this paradigm. Data as well as operations are encapsulated as objects. Objects interact by the means of message passing, by calling methods on other entities. 

## Event Driven Programming
Event driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program  depends on the events, such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs or messages from programs. Event driven programming is manily used in graphical user interfaces (such as Javascript web applications) that focuses certain actions in response to user input.
