#Features Within an IDE
##What Are the Features?
###Source Code Editor
A source code editor is a text editor environment where the developers can edit their source code of computer programs. One of these features a source code editor uses is Auto Completion, which prompts suggestions for arguments or variables, and this saves time for developers while writing up code. Another feature the editor provides is called syntax checks, which checks for incorrect use of syntax and highlights any errors.
###Debugger
This is a program within the IDE that is used to test and debug other programs within the code.  Once the debugger detects an error, it will let the user know where the error exists by providing the line number and what kind of error it might be. This can be useful for analysing bugs or problems, so the user can easily identify and fix them. 
###Compiler
This is special program which transforms source code written in a particular programming language and converts it into machine language. This will allow the program to be executable. This can be is useful as the developer can make changes and compile the source code repeatedly for testing purposes.
###Syntax Highlighting
Most IDEs incorporate this feature, as it displays text in different colours and fonts according to the category of terms in programming languages. Its main purpose is to improve readability of the code and context of the text, as users easily ignore large sections of code. This makes developers programming easier to write up.
