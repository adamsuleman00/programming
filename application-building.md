# The Development Process
## Introduction
This report will cover the topic of what an algorithm is and how useful it is in programming. In addition, we will look into the process of building an application; this includes the different phases and models with in the development process. 
The development process of an application will be divided and looked at in their individual phases. The following phases will be at analysed and explained which are:
•	Requirements Phase
•	Design Phase
•	Implementation Phase
•	Testing Phase
•	Maintenance Phase
## Algorithms
### Definition
An algorithm in general terms is a set of rules/instructions used to solve a problem. They can be used to perform from simple to complex tasks. They are often implemented in the form of functions in programming, they act as small programs which can be used by the main program to perform specific tasks.
### Uses
In application development, algorithms are very useful, as they help to break down problems into smaller and manageable processes, which prevent the large problem in the first place. This can be very beneficial in the application development, as problems can range from simple to complex, which requires large amount of programming and time to be invested. 
When it comes to solving a particular problem, the first step is determined and applied in theory, either in flowchart or pseudocode. This approach allows the problem to be easily understandable and better understanding of how the algorithm can be used in the final stages of the program. Next step, once a design is decided; an algorithm can then be implemented depending on the programmers programming language of choice. This process of using an algorithm to determine the design and implementation is incorporated in the second and third phases of developing a software application.
## Development Models
Development models will use steps that converted to the five phases and will then define methodologies and principles that plan how the development will run between the phases during the development. The main principle will affect the development flow whether the development model is iterative and sequential. This depends on the programmer choice on what is the best approach for the development.
## Development Phases
### Requirements Phase
The user requirements of the application are discussed with the clients. The team and upper management will discuss and plans the suitable steps for the project. This step is crucial in order to understand and finalize the applications core requirements in order to prevent the team from making any mistakes, in order to produce a better product.
### Design Phase
The design phase is when the all of the user requirements outlined in phase one are taken in to attention appropriate steps are planned out. This will cover the way the systems will be used such as flowchart or psudocode, what the system architecture will be presented to look like, user interface, and user experience. 
### Implementation Phase
The implementation phase is where the application is developed from beginning to the final product. This phase uses the design plans from previous phase and is implemented into an application that meets the user requirements and result in a working application.
### Testing Phase
During the testing phase, the application will be tested to ensure it works as intended to its requirements. It is important to ensure that the application is working correctly before being presented to the client. This phase allows the developers to find any bugs or problems, and to fix these issues before releasing the final product 
### Maintenance Phase
Most clients’ products development does not end once it is released. The clients will require continued regular support, such as fixing any bugs, or future compatibility updates may also need to be considered, and implementing new features.
